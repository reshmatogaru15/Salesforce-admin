The objective of this project is to build a centralized issue tracking system within
Salesforce, where admins create cases internally based on reported civic
problems. The system automatically routes cases to the correct departments,
sends status updates via email, and supports reopening of cases after a defined
period. It aims to improve transparency, accountability and service quality using
standard Salesforce automation.
